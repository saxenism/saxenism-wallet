 * @notice Protocol-level interface for Saxenism wallet deployment and lifecycle management
 * @dev This interface defines the complete Factory API for:
 *      - Deploying new wallet instances with CREATE2 (cross-chain consistency)
 *      - Managing implementation versions and lifecycle
 *      - Emergency protocol controls (pause/remove implementations)
 *      - Privileged administrative functions
 * 
 * Security Design Principles:
 * - Privileged admin controls implementation lifecycle (emergency response)
 * - User autonomy preserved (each wallet chooses upgrade timing)
 * - CREATE2 deployment ensures cross-chain address consistency
 * - Version management enables gradual rollouts and rollbacks
 * - Emergency controls for rapid incident response
